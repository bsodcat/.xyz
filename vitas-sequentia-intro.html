			<h2>[Prologue - VITAS SEQUENTIA]</h2><br>
			<p style="font-family: Libre Baskerville;">
			
			<p>This story is one that begins with tragedy and ends with tragedy. Nothing here will be understood beyond the base emotions we are pre-programmed with by natural selection. Words will help, but the rest is left to you to figure out. I am tired and am in need of rest. Unless you seek the truth, I will ask for nothing but silence as this is a story greater than time, stone, metal, or flesh.</p>
      
      <p>
      They call it an &quot;outproxy,&quot; a city adjacent to the ruins of the previous civilization. Most of it is filled with humans, or something like them, that never really changes at all. Nothing happens here that you won't find in gossip circles all around. Each day is no different; selling, trading, hauling, general commerce, and overwatch are mandated by engineered humans, or obedient clones. The city itself is made of metal and stone, and rain and darkness may pass, but you don't see it here. Today a cloud sat almost as if it was waiting south of a town in east London, as it always does since August of this year. No one gave it a second thought. However, this cloud was different. It was black, not grey, which obviously put people at ease. Figures of people drag the rusted wet metal on dry steel rails, ringing in the underbelly of the city tunnels. The walls of this city are patterned with what looks like sound dampened for when loud trains pass by so close to the stacked housings along the spillway. No grass or trees. No one even knows what a tree is. Not even dirt, not really, anyways. Each time it rains, you'd think there would be praise as greenhouses are common above the underbelly. But as nice as that would be, it isn't water. Caustic rain filled with heavy medals and hydrochloric acids slams the metal roofs, the radiation of which heats the greenhouses and creates moisture from within. Forget the fact that there was food growing in them, there would be no value in that. What grows around these areas is mostly drugs.</p>
      
      <p>
      Under this, it is mostly shops and residential. Of course, the skies are filled with wires and cables, but most of these are for power rather than data. Most of the jobs these people have are in the redistribution of information, mostly because everything on the intranet is tracked by the overwatch program. Material Printers from scrap are cheaper than transportation or even some cybernetics, so much of what else goes on is manufacturing: guns, machine parts for any number of things. Factions rose and fell before and after this city. The lack of energy is what keeps most of the fighting at a minimum since a lot of people live either in packs of families or, stark in contrast, live alone completely or don't trust a single person, not even their dealer. Animals are all extinct and have been for about 400 years. Most of what you see are mechanisms for show or to serve as protection. Forgers are in the subterranean or wasteways. Faking your identity or completely changing is the norm in order to maintain privacy or protection. Most forgers go under a pen-name for every cybernetic part they make. Of course, competition is in the quality of the parts. The main manufacturers are those of large companies. Forgers who have quality parts have runningmen who are a medium for the shipping of the best ones and charge a premium. Never take a product from a forger who doesn't ask for a charge. Forgers are alternatively named blacksmiths as they can create entire bodies, suits, and exo-skeletons. Each is handmade, so they can't be modified as easily. Most are considered works of art.</p>
      
      <p>
      The cities around it, like outproxy, like Daemonkit and Innerlink, all surround the megacity called the core.</p>
      
      <p>Each gate to the core is known as a heavens gate, and it is guarded by sentinels, giant android humanoids with multiple limbs and a symbol on their chest.</p>

			<h2>[Scene 1 Act 1]</h2><br>
		  <p style="font-family: Libre Baskerville;">
      
      <p>Isn't there something lovely about it?</p>
      
      <p>A process of elimination by execution, a guiding force, almost a law in regards to keeping order. However simple it might sound, there is without doubt a strangeness to the execution. At first, you don't feel anything, as per protocol. After a time, there is a light somewhere shapeless and endless. It expands with the passage of time, and it appears as if the subjects are speaking to you by staring at you.What are they thinking? Are they believing it? Is this what we died for?</p><br>
      
      <h2>Chapter I - Runaway Slave</h2><br>
      
      <p>
      A voice booms in along hallway with the sound of high heels stepping in rhythmic pattern. &quot;There is no action without a corresponding reaction.The universe is guided by this simple principle: cause and effect. You cannot do this without something being done to cause it to be so. This is the truth of fate and the reality of the world. Don't like it? Dream up a better one!&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      ....</p>
      
      <p>
      The the voice lowers in echo, with a piercing silence.</p>
      
      <p>Among the walkers there are piles of twitching pyramid scrap heaps, blinking and spurring into insanity. A hand crawls with some semblance of intelligence, avoiding being transplanted by a prisoner. Splashing footsteps fade in and out for a brief moment. The wind picks up as if it were chasing them. Multiple figures cut through the wild grass like sharp knives, weaving in between abandoned highways and rooftops.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;HAHA! What idiots for leaving their shit out in the open where I could see it! Huh?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The bigger android running with the thief turns its head around one-eighty while still sprinting to scan the figures behind them.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;There are four of them, Ma'am. Each with a communications blister and 50kg of ammo. I reccomend-&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Alright alright, Damn!&quot;Can't they just give up already? I'm tired of having to get this stupid part every time I fuck up.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>The thief jumps on top of the android and raises its hood.The android raises his arm and it detaches itself as the pink-haired thief uses it as a rocket launcher to launch various spare parts the android is made of at the concealed enemies behind them. After she lands a hit on one, the figures fire in unison. The two intersect a railway and head down it. The pink-haired thief knocks on the head of the android:</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Hello!? What time is it?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;1500 hours, ma'am.&quot; the android responds while dodging gunfire.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Excellent! We are almost ready.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The dark gushes of turbulent wind slowly creep up, and suddenly a train blows through one of the pursuers with a violent thud and the clanking of steel as the two thieves somersault atop the train. What was left of the dark clouds appeared as two humanoid shades rising from the front of the train.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Two down, two to go!&quot; says Tsuko.</p>
      
      <p>
      They sprint along the train backwards, gaining distance before hiding between carts. The sound of prying metal can be heard, and finally, the sound of mechanized uncoupling. Ah the two traincars split along the tracks the girl lets out a deep sigh.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;That'll keep them busy for the time being.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      For a brief moment, the couple relaxes.The pink-haired thief undoes her cloak fully and reveals an intricate array of mechanized exoskeleton supports on her collar bones and forearms piercing through her old clothes and jacket. She stands up and stretches upon a sudden shaking of the train car slowing to a halt. The android's old school monitor for a face begins to light and flicker, showing a boot process and connection status before tuning itself into the radio, revealing their heist.</p>
      
      <p>
      The two were seen jettisoning from the main array while on the run near 4595 Substation G2 Sector 7. Weirdly enough, the threat is minimal as what was reported to be stolen was in fact just data and no products from ADOM were targeted.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;That's what they think.&quot; the girls said, closing their eyes.</p>
      
      <p>
      She pulls out the mostly spherical object and takes a plug from her wrist and pulls a wire out to plug into the object, sending her eyes into shock. Her body rag dolls were hanging on the edge of the railing. The android rises quickly and picks the girl up before hopping off the train cart and heading into town.</p>
      
      <p>
      The android sighs from a walkie-talkie like voice: &quot;Twelve hours in and I still don't get paid.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      He continues, laying her down on a wall, and takes a couple of parts from a heap and begins welding and tinkering. &quot;Ya know, if you weren't such a high-risk target, I would probably find another job.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The girl wakes back up screaming in joy: &quot;WOOOO HAHA, yeah, good luck with that...&quot;</p>
      
      <p>The android looks up and then back down, continuing what he was doing.</p>
      
      <p>&quot;There aren't enough nanites to keep you from going under again. We will have to buy more if you keep trying to splice manually.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>&quot;I understand. It's fine. It makes me feel free, like a bird.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>&quot;Madetsuko? What's a bird? &quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;I told you to call me Tsuko. Nevermind that. What have you come up with?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      He holds up a makeshift radio transmitter and gently hits the top of his head with it.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;What, you need assistance?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;I can't see the back of my head anymore, can I?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Okay, okay, but don't judge my wiring jobs, OK?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The girl exclaims, &quot;And what is this talk about you worrying about my degradation? You know I'm good for another 5000 something weeks&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The android hangs his head before replying, &quot;It was 5735.71 weeks when we were near the processing plant, we are now 3128.57 weeks from where we started. You do know they cut production of M2's right? You have 2607.14 weeks of cycles before any stock heap within 900,000km is used up.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      The girl interjects, &quot;focus on the mission. We have a job to finish, and you're getting paid this time. Otherwise, I'm breaking this dude's kneecaps and soldering his eyes to his feet.&quot; Honestly, who does he think he is trying to pull a fast one on us? How was I supposed to know our target had level ten security in a neurtal zone? &quot;></p>
      
      <p>She sighs, finishing her work and installing the makeshift radio into the android's head.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Gerion, I'll be fine, promise?Leave your channels open. I'm going to see if we can't get something to eat.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      Geryon stands up and raises his hand to extend an antenna out of his hand and pointer finger. The sound of static clears as she tunes his knobs to where his chin would be. There is rustling under the dunes of scrap and dirt. A crack is formed at the bottom of the valley and a mechanical worm maw whurs itself to life. The couple retreat into an area resembling a park.</p>
      
      <p>
      Tsuko murmurs&quot;Woah woah, wait, why was this place made if there haven't been children in decades?&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      Suddenly, several worms appear around the park equipment made with the flesh of androids. How is it that we became food?! &quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      Geryon raises his right arm and slams it onto a pile of cube-shaped scrap and launches it at the worms. Two of them burst into black-silver liquid and hydrophobic metal scrap. The third biggest worm towers over them two-fold and engulfs Geryon entirely.</p>
      
      <p>
      Tsuko slams her fist on the worm, yelling, &quot;HEY YOU BIG AMALGAMATED PILE OF SCRAP! Let us Kick Your ASS! YOU-&quot;</p>
      
      <p>The worm bulges and bursts with Geryon in a &quot;T&quot; pose with large triangular knives. He shouts excitedly, &quot;Look what I just found! &quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      Tsuko stands up and puts her hands on her hips, &quot;That's not food, Geryon.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>&quot;I can keep these right.&quot; Geryon spins the knives, looking surprised.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Only if you don't mind me carrying them for you!&quot; She picks up a couple pieces of worm like logs for a fire and heads to a half-devastated apartment.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Bring some, I hope we've got something flint-like.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      After sundown, the couple lay across a fire made with the corpses of the worms while also feeding on the silver-black liquid inside. Geryon drinks the lubricant from his chest cavity.</p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;I think this is grade 2 or 3 lubricant. It was made before I was designed.&quot;<p>
      
      <p>
      &quot;Don't tamper with your food.&quot; Tsuko replies, &quot;Or I'll resort to feeding you silicon-based scrap instead.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>
      They finish their dinner and run diagnostics before shutting down for the night. The hums of wild machines creep around the corners of buildings and dead trees.</p>
